# Abstract
This study explores the behavioural responses of seals to various disturbances while hauling out within a transport hub featuring diverse transport facilities. Utilising Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) on observations from September 2021 to May 2023 in Ísafjörður, Iceland, the research reveals that watercraft, particularly kayaks, significantly affect seal haul-out behaviour, triggering vigilance and flush responses. Aerial vehicles also induce stress responses, whereas road-based vehicles have lower impacts. These findings highlight the substantial influence of human activities, especially transportation, on seal haul-out behaviour, suggesting a need for mitigating strategies to reduce these impacts.
