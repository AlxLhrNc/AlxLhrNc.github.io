Completely unrelated to my own project, this adventure in the Tasman Sea on board the [RV Investigator](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/mnf/research-vessel-equipment-data/rv-investigator) was a great one. I would do anything to repeat it, and contribute to oceanography with such a great crew again.

Sydney
======
Second experience with Aussie, and I kind of like it. Nice peoples, good weather, plenty of stuff to see. One question though, why do you call Australian white ibis "_Bin Chicken_"

I then related these to plankton composition in the water.

Tracking fine-scale front with TK
======
While sampling the Gulf was fun, I did not do it randomly, moving Te Kaihōpara wherever I wanted. I relied on the [pyBOA](https://alxlhrnc.github.io/portfolio/2023_pyBOA/).

By doing so, I tried to make sure to have a story to tell about plankton accross front. Or more accurately, answer the question "_Do Plankton change accross small scale fronts ?_".

Fauna observation
======
Although I did not take fauna observation from Te Kaihōpara for my project, and instead used a dataset provided to me by fisheries, I still had the chance to witness a few dolphins and mantas while out in the Gulf.
