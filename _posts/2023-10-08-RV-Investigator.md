Completely unrelated to my own Ph.D. project, this adventure in the Tasman Sea on board the [RV Investigator](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/mnf/research-vessel-equipment-data/rv-investigator) was a great one. I would do anything to repeat it, and contribute to oceanography with such a great crew again.

Second experience with Oz, and I kind of like it. Nice peoples, good weather, plenty of stuff to see. One question though, why do you call Australian white ibis "_Bin Chicken_"?

Tasman Sea
=====
I saw a lot of water during this trip and sort of messed up my sleep schedule. 12h shifts are untertaining, especially at night (I was on the 4pm-4am rotation). Got to meet plenty of amazing people on the crew, both scientists and sailors. That really helped broaden my understanding of my own work and how I fit in the grand web of science.
