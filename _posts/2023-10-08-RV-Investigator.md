Completely unrelated to my own project, this adventure in the Tasman Sea on board the [RV Investigator](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/mnf/research-vessel-equipment-data/rv-investigator) was a great one. I would do anything to repeat it, and contribute to oceanography with such a great crew again.

Second experience with Aussie, and I kind of like it. Nice peoples, good weather, plenty of stuff to see. One question though, why do you call Australian white ibis "_Bin Chicken_".
