So, I guess my request to the ocean gods worked? Because I got to get back on a boat, and do more science! Working on Inkfish's RV-Hydra with the Oceanly team was a gift, really.

BPQ

Spending 5 days to test for Covid prior to traveling gave me time to work, do a bit of datamining and meet all 3 of Oceanly's members. I'd say they're all great people. Passionate, intelligent and bubbly, they really create an environment where I felt confortable working and progressing as a scientist.

Solomons
=====
Hydra's crew and equipment was mind blowing. Sure, the niskins were a bit small (2L) when compared to the Investigator's (12L), but I still got to do very good stuff. CTD 12h cast were interesting too, and there even was 2 submarines, not that I was able to get  on one though. Little sad about this, but there is always next time, right?
