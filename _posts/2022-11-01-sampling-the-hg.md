As my Ph.D focused in [Tīkapa Moana Te Moana Nui a Toi the Hauraki Gulf](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hauraki+Gulf+%2F+T%C4%ABkapa+Moana/@-36.6598107,174.9040613,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d732874b6b9dd5f:0x2a00ef616659ae50!8m2!3d-36.5988941!4d175.1894045!16zL20vMDNyc21j?entry=ttu), I had to do a fair bit of field work, wether as a Teaching Assistant or for my own research.

CTDs
======
As we were only interested in surface water, it was feasible to drop the CTD probe by hand. The real pickle was matching the points between the [CastAway](https://www.ysi.com/castaway-ctd), the [RBR](https://rbr-global.com/products/standard-loggers/rbrduo-ct/), and [Te Kaihōpara](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/institute-of-marine-science/marine-science-research/te-kaihopara-research-vessel.html)'s GPS. This gave us pretty images like this one.

I then related these to plankton composition in the water.

Tracking fine-scale front with TK
======
While sampling the Gulf was fun, I did not do it randomly, moving Te Kaihōpara wherever I wanted. I relied on the [pyBOA](https://alxlhrnc.github.io/portfolio/2023_pyBOA/).

By doing so, I tried to make sure to have a story to tell about plankton accross front. Or more accurately, answer the question "_Do Plankton change accross small scale fronts ?_".

Fauna observation
======
Although I did not take fauna observation from Te Kaihōpara for my project, and instead used a dataset provided to me by fisheries, I still had the chance to witness a few dolphins and mantas while out in the Gulf.

Thank you to all the little hands that helped for my own sampling
