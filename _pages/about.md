Kia Ora/Welcome. I am Alexandre Lheriau-Nice, a Ph.D. candidate at the [IMS](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/institute-of-marine-science.html), of the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html).

I am currently investigating the bio-physical coupling in the [Hauraki Gulf](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hauraki+Gulf+%2F+T%C4%ABkapa+Moana/@-36.6598107,174.9040613,9z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6d732874b6b9dd5f:0x2a00ef616659ae50!8m2!3d-36.5988941!4d175.1894045!16zL20vMDNyc21j?entry=ttu). I do so using mainly Python and R, dissecting datasets from satellites and fisheries.
My supervisors are [Dr. Alwyn Rees](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/ta-rees) and [Dr. Alice Della Penna](https://twitter.com/alidrifting).
