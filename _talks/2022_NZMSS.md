# Motivation
Fronts and eddies are common features in the ocean, whether in the open sea environment, or along the coasts. While the knowledge of large scale features is growing [2, 3], very little is known about finer structures, i.e. around 1km scale.
This project aims to understand the submesoscale circulation in the Hauraki Gulf-Bay of Plenty area and its impact on the ecosystem. Fronts and other structures in the 1km scale are highly variable in time, and stay stable for a week at most. In order to detect them with precision, it is necessary to scan multiple images in a short time. We use an algorithm processing ocean color images showing chlorophyll at very fine resolution (0.3km).
