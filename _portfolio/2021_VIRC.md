The **Vigur Island Research Campain** was instigated by [David Pierre Milesi-Gaches](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Pierre-Milesi-Gaches) with my help.
It took place on [Vigur Island](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vigur/@66.0526208,-22.8869962,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4f2b2266fa42da5b:0x38d298d93804d098!8m2!3d66.0554547!4d-22.8289032!16s%2Fg%2F121vx2fv?entry=ttu) in the Westfjords of Iceland.
The primary field work too place from June to July 2021, the analysis and publication are ongoing as of 2024. 

This project looked into multiple species inlcuding [Arctic terns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_tern), [Black guillemots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_guillemot) or [Harbour seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_seal).

Birds
=====
The VIRC looked at a wide variety of birds including Black Guillemots, [Northern Fulmars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fulmar), [Great Cormorants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_cormorant), [Gulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larus), [Eurasian Oystercatchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_oystercatcher), and Arctic Terns
This allowed us to conduct the first census of the area, which results can be found here: [Census publication](https://alxlhrnc.github.io/publication/2022_10_10_BCN_Iceland).
We also mapped the different populations of the island, and described the shape and density of the Arctic terns colonny (both presented in the [census](https://alxlhrnc.github.io/publication/2022_10_10_BCN_Iceland)).

The stern colonny was then monitored by David for the years 2022 and 2023 in addition to a guillemots nest count. Results in the near future.

Seals
=====
Vigur hosted two species of seals, the Harbour abd the [Grey seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_seal).
We observed a colonny of mixed individuals (though Harbour seals were a majority), and tried to relate the seals hauling behaviour to tourism presence and human behavu=iours.

Primary results show that the seals behaviour is impacted by human presences, especially approaching by foot from land or on board kayaks from the sea.

We decided to pair the study of Vigur's colonny with one from a near-by fjord, [Hvítanes](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seal+lookout/@66.0167999,-22.8603031,11.63z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x48bc31d5fefcfbcb:0x858d8bfe97312ea7!2sHv%C3%ADtanes,+Faroe+Islands!3b1!8m2!3d62.0436957!4d-6.7729601!16zL20vMDRiczFf!3m5!1s0x4f2b23ef016e73e7:0xf2d9a0b1f01e0c6b!8m2!3d65.9936302!4d-22.8146881!16s%2Fg%2F11g88sysdy?entry=ttu).
